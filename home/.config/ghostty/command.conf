# The command to run, usually a shell.
# If this is not an absolute path, it'll be looked up in the `PATH`.
# If this is not set, a default will be looked up from your system.
# The rules for the default lookup are:
#
#   * `SHELL` environment variable
#
#   * `passwd` entry (user information)
#
# This can contain additional arguments to run the command with.
# If additional arguments are provided,
# the command will be executed using `/bin/sh -c`.
# Ghostty does not do any shell command parsing.
#
# This command will be used for all new terminal surfaces, i.e. new windows, tabs, etc.
# If you want to run a command only for the first terminal surface created when Ghostty starts, use the `initial-command` configuration.
#
# Ghostty supports the common `-e` flag for executing a command with arguments.
# For example, `ghostty -e fish --with --custom --args`.
# This flag sets the `initial-command` configuration, see that for more information.
command =

# This is the same as "command", but only applies to the first terminal surface created when Ghostty starts.
# Subsequent terminal surfaces will use the `command` configuration.
#
# After the first terminal surface is created (or closed),
# there is no way to run this initial command again automatically.
# As such, setting this at runtime works but will only affect the next terminal surface if it is the first one ever created.
#
#
# If you're using the `ghostty` CLI there is also a shortcut to set this with arguments directly: you can use the `-e` flag.
# For example: `ghostty -e fish --with --custom --args`.
# The `-e` flag automatically forces some other behaviors as well:
#
#   * `gtk-single-instance=false` - This ensures that a new instance is launched and the CLI args are respected.
#
#   * `quit-after-last-window-closed=true` - This ensures that the Ghostty process will exit when the command exits.
#     Additionally, the `quit-after-last-window-closed-delay` is unset.
#
#   * `shell-integration=detect` (if not `none`) -
#     This prevents forcibly injecting any configured shell integration into the command's environment.
#     With `-e` its highly unlikely that you're executing a shell and forced shell integration is likely to cause problems
#     (i.e. by wrapping your command in a shell, setting env vars, etc.).
#     This is a safety measure to prevent unexpected behavior.
#     If you want shell integration with a `-e`-executed command,
#     you must either name your binary appopriately or source the shell integration script manually.

# If true, keep the terminal open after the command exits.
# Normally, the terminal window closes when the running command (such as a shell) exits.
# With this true, the terminal window will stay open until any keypress is received.
#
# This is primarily useful for scripts or debugging.
wait-after-command = false

# The number of milliseconds of runtime below which we consider a process exit to be abnormal.
# This is used to show an error message when the process exits too quickly.
#
# On Linux, this must be paired with a non-zero exit code.
# On macOS, we allow any exit code because of the way shell processes are launched via the login command.
abnormal-command-exit-runtime = 250

# The directory to change to after starting the command.
#
# This setting is secondary to the `window-inherit-working-directory` setting.
# If a previous Ghostty terminal exists in the same process, `window-inherit-working-directory` will take precedence.
# Otherwise, this setting will be used.
# Typically, this setting is used only for the first window.
#
# The default is `inherit` except in special scenarios listed next.
# On macOS, if Ghostty can detect it is launched from launchd (double-clicked) or `open`, then it defaults to `home`.
# On Linux with GTK, if Ghostty can detect it was launched from a desktop launcher, then it defaults to `home`.
#
# The value of this must be an absolute value or one of the special values
# below:
#
#   * `home` - The home directory of the executing user.
#
#   * `inherit` - The working directory of the launching process.
