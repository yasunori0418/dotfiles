# The method to use for calculating the cell width of a grapheme cluster.
# The default value is `unicode` which uses the Unicode standard to determine grapheme width.
# This results in correct grapheme width but may result in cursor-desync issues with some programs (such as shells) that may use a legacy method such as `wcswidth`.
#
# Valid values are:
#
# * `legacy` - Use a legacy method to determine grapheme width,
# such as wcswidth This maximizes compatibility with legacy programs but may result in incorrect grapheme width for certain graphemes such as skin-tone emoji,
# non-English characters, etc.
#
#   This is called "legacy" and not something more specific because the behavior is undefined and we want to retain the ability to modify it.
#   For example, we may or may not use libc `wcswidth` now or in the future.
#
# * `unicode` - Use the Unicode standard to determine grapheme width.
#
# If a running program explicitly enables terminal mode 2027, then `unicode` width will be forced regardless of this configuration.
# When mode 2027 is reset, this configuration will be used again.
#
# This configuration can be changed at runtime but will not affect existing terminals.
# Only new terminals will use the new configuration.

# The font families to use.
#
# You can generate the list of valid values using the CLI:
#
#     ghostty +list-fonts
#
# This configuration can be repeated multiple times to specify preferred fallback fonts when the requested codepoint is not available in the primary font.
# This is particularly useful for multiple languages, symbolic fonts, etc.
#
# Notes on emoji specifically:
# On macOS, Ghostty by default will always use Apple Color Emoji and on Linux will always use Noto Emoji.
# You can override this behavior by specifying a font family here that contains emoji glyphs.
#
# The specific styles (bold, italic, bold italic) do not need to be explicitly set.
# If a style is not set, then the regular style (font-family) will be searched for stylistic variants.
# If a stylistic variant is not found, Ghostty will use the regular style.
# This prevents falling back to a different font family just to get a style such as bold.
# This also applies if you explicitly specify a font family for a style.
# For example,
# if you set `font-family-bold = FooBar` and "FooBar" cannot be found,
# Ghostty will use whatever font is set for `font-family` for the bold style.
#
# Finally, some styles may be synthesized if they are not supported.
# For example, if a font does not have an italic style and no alternative italic font is specified,
# Ghostty will synthesize an italic style by applying a slant to the regular style.
# If you want to disable these synthesized styles then you can use the `font-style` configurations as documented below.
#
# You can disable styles completely by using the `font-style` set of configurations.
# See the documentation for `font-style` for more information.
#
# If you want to overwrite a previous set value rather than append a fallback,
# specify the value as `""` (empty string) to reset the list and then set the new values.
# For example:
#
#     font-family = ""
#     font-family = "My Favorite Font"
#
# Setting any of these as CLI arguments will automatically clear the
# values set in configuration files so you don't need to specify
# `--font-family=""` before setting a new value. You only need to specify
# this within config files if you want to clear previously set values in
# configuration files or on the CLI if you want to clear values set on the
# CLI.
#
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals, i.e. new windows, tabs, etc.

#
# You can also use these fields to completely disable a font style.
# If you set the value of the configuration below to literal `false` then that font style will be disabled.
# If the running program in the terminal requests a disabled font style,
# the regular font style will be used instead.
#

# Control whether Ghostty should synthesize a style if the requested style is not available in the specified font-family.
#
# Ghostty can synthesize bold, italic, and bold italic styles if the font does not have a specific style.
# For bold, this is done by drawing an outline around the glyph of varying thickness.
# For italic, this is done by applying a slant to the glyph.
# For bold italic, both of these are applied.
#
# Synthetic styles are not perfect and will generally not look as good as a font that has the style natively.
# However, they are useful to provide styled text when the font does not have the style.
#
# Set this to "false" or "true" to disable or enable synthetic styles completely.
# You can disable specific styles using "no-bold", "no-italic", and "no-bold-italic".
# You can disable multiple styles by separating them with a comma.
# For example, "no-bold, no-italic".
#
# Available style keys are: `bold`, `italic`, `bold-italic`.
#
# If synthetic styles are disabled,
# then the regular style will be used instead if the requested style is not available.
# If the font has the requested style,
# then the font will be used as-is since the style is not synthetic.
#
# Warning: An easy mistake is to disable `bold` or `italic` but not `bold-italic`.
# Disabling only `bold` or `italic` will NOT disable either in the `bold-italic` style.
# If you want to disable `bold-italic`, you must explicitly disable it.
# You cannot partially disable `bold-italic`.
#
# By default, synthetic styles are enabled.

# Apply a font feature.
# This can be repeated multiple times to enable multiple font features.
# You can NOT set multiple font features with a single value (yet).
#
# The font feature will apply to all fonts rendered by Ghostty.
# A future enhancement will allow targeting specific faces.
#
# A valid value is the name of a feature.
# Prefix the feature with a `-` to explicitly disable it.
# Example: `ss20` or `-ss20`.
#
# To disable programming ligatures, use `-calt` since this is the typical feature name for programming ligatures.
# To look into what font features your font has and what they do, use a font inspection tool such as [fontdrop.info](https://fontdrop.info).
#
# To generally disable most ligatures, use `-calt`, `-liga`, and `-dlig` (as separate repetitive entries in your config).

# This value can be a non-integer and the nearest integer pixel size will be selected.

# For example, 13.5pt @ 2px/pt = 27px
#
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals,
# i.e. new windows, tabs, etc.
# Note that you may still not see the change depending on your `window-inherit-font-size` setting.
# If that setting is true, only the first window will be affected by this change since all subsequent windows will inherit the font size of the previous window.

# A repeatable configuration to set one or more font variations values for a variable font.
# A variable font is a single font,
# usually with a filename ending in `-VF.ttf` or `-VF.otf` that contains one or more configurable axes for things such as weight, slant, etc.
# Not all fonts support variations;
# only fonts that explicitly state they are variable fonts will work.
#
# The format of this is `id=value` where `id` is the axis identifier.
# An axis identifier is always a 4 character string, such as `wght`.
# To get the list of supported axes,
# look at your font documentation or use a font inspection tool.
#
# Invalid ids and values are usually ignored.
# For example, if a font only supports weights from 100 to 700, setting `wght=800` will do nothing (it will not be clamped to 700).
# You must consult your font's documentation to see what values are supported.
#
#
# Common axes are: `wght` (weight), `slnt` (slant), `ital` (italic), `opsz` (optical size), `wdth` (width), `GRAD` (gradient), etc.
