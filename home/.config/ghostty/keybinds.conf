# Key bindings. The format is `trigger=action`. Duplicate triggers will
# overwrite previously set values. The list of actions is available in
# the documentation or using the `ghostty +list-actions` command.

# Trigger: `+`-separated list of keys and modifiers. Example: `ctrl+a`,
# `ctrl+shift+b`, `up`. Some notes:
#   * modifiers cannot repeat, `ctrl+ctrl+a` is invalid.
#   * modifiers and keys can be in any order, `shift+a+ctrl` is *weird*, but valid.
#   * only a single key input is allowed, `ctrl+a+b` is invalid.
#   * the key input can be prefixed with `physical:` to specify a physical key mapping rather than a logical one.
#     A physical key mapping responds to the hardware keycode and not the keycode translated by any system keyboard layouts.
#     Example: "ctrl+physical:a"

# Valid modifiers are `shift`, `ctrl` (alias: `control`), `alt` (alias: `opt`, `option`), and `super` (alias: `cmd`, `command`).
# You may use the modifier or the alias.
# When debugging keybinds, the non-aliased modifier will always be used in output.
# Note: The fn or "globe" key on keyboards are not supported as a modifier.
# This is a limitation of the operating systems and GUI toolkits that Ghostty uses.

# You may also specify multiple triggers separated by `>` to require a sequence of triggers to activate the action.
# For example, `ctrl+a>n=new_window` will only trigger the `new_window` action if the user presses `ctrl+a` followed separately by `n`.
# In other software, this is sometimes called a leader key, a key chord, a key table, etc.
# There is no hardcoded limit on the number of parts in a sequence.
# Warning: If you define a sequence as a CLI argument to `ghostty`,
# you probably have to quote the keybind since `>` is a special character in most shells.
# Example: ghostty --keybind='ctrl+a>n=new_window'

# A trigger sequence has some special handling:
#   * Ghostty will wait an indefinite amount of time for the next key in the sequence.
#     There is no way to specify a timeout.
#     The only way to force the output of a prefix key is to assign another keybind to specifically output that key (i.e. `ctrl+a>ctrl+a=text:foo`)
#     or press an unbound key which will send both keys to the program.
#   * If a prefix in a sequence is previously bound,
#     the sequence will override the previous binding.
#     For example, if `ctrl+a` is bound to `new_window` and `ctrl+a>n` is bound to `new_tab`, pressing `ctrl+a` will do nothing.
#   * Adding to the above,
#     if a previously bound sequence prefix is used in a new,
#     non-sequence binding,
#     the entire previously bound sequence will be unbound.
#     For example,
#     if you bind `ctrl+a>n` and `ctrl+a>t`,
#     and then bind `ctrl+a` directly,
#     both `ctrl+a>n` and `ctrl+a>t` will become unbound.
#   * Trigger sequences are not allowed for `global:` or `all:`-prefixed triggers.
#     This is a limitation we could remove in the future.

# Action is the action to take when the trigger is satisfied.
# It takes the format `action` or `action:param`.
# The latter form is only valid if the action requires a parameter.
#   * `ignore` - Do nothing, ignore the key input.
#     This can be used to black hole certain inputs to have no effect.
#   * `unbind` - Remove the binding.
#     This makes it so the previous action is removed,
#     and the key will be sent through to the child command if it is printable.
#   * `csi:text` - Send a CSI sequence. i.e. `csi:A` sends "cursor up".
#   * `esc:text` - Send an escape sequence.
#     i.e. `esc:d` deletes to the end of the word to the right.
#   * `text:text` - Send a string. Uses Zig string literal syntax.
#     i.e. `text:\x15` sends Ctrl-U.
#   * All other actions can be found in the documentation or by using the `ghostty +list-actions` command.

# Some notes for the action:
#   * The parameter is taken as-is after the `:`.
#     Double quotes or other mechanisms are included and NOT parsed.
#     If you want to send a string value that includes spaces,
#     wrap the entire trigger/action in double quotes.
#     Example: `--keybind="up=csi:A B"`

# There are some additional special values that can be specified for keybind:
#   * `keybind=clear` will clear all set keybindings.
#     Warning: this removes ALL keybindings up to this point,
#     including the default keybindings.

# The keybind trigger can be prefixed with some special values to change the behavior of the keybind.
# These are:
#   * `all:` - Make the keybind apply to all terminal surfaces.
#     By default, keybinds only apply to the focused terminal surface.
#     If this is true, then the keybind will be sent to all terminal surfaces.
#     This only applies to actions that are surface-specific.
#     For actions that are already global (i.e. `quit`),
#     this prefix has no effect.
#   * `global:` - Make the keybind global.
#     By default, keybinds only work within Ghostty and under the right conditions (application focused, sometimes terminal focused, etc.).
#     If you want a keybind to work globally across your system (i.e. even when Ghostty is not focused), specify this prefix.
#     This prefix implies `all:`.
#     Note: this does not work in all environments; see the additional notes below for more information.
#   * `unconsumed:` - Do not consume the input.
#     By default, a keybind will consume the input,
#     meaning that the associated encoding (if any) will not be sent to the running program in the terminal.
#     If you wish to send the encoded value to the program,
#     specify the `unconsumed:` prefix before the entire keybind.
#     For example: `unconsumed:ctrl+a=reload_config`.
#     `global:` and `all:`-prefixed keybinds will always consume the input regardless of this setting.
#     Since they are not associated with a specific terminal surface, they're never encoded.

# Keybind triggers are not unique per prefix combination.
# For example, `ctrl+a` and `global:ctrl+a` are not two separate keybinds.
# The keybind set later will overwrite the keybind set earlier.
# In this case, the `global:` keybind will be used.
# Multiple prefixes can be specified.
# For example, `global:unconsumed:ctrl+a=reload_config` will make the keybind global and not consume the input to reload the config.
# Note: `global:` is only supported on macOS.
# On macOS, this feature requires accessibility permissions to be granted to Ghostty.
# When a `global:` keybind is specified and Ghostty is launched or reloaded,
# Ghostty will attempt to request these permissions.
# If the permissions are not granted, the keybind will not work.
# On macOS, you can find these permissions in System Preferences -> Privacy & Security -> Accessibility.
