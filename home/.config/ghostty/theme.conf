# A theme to use.
# This can be a built-in theme name, a custom theme name, or an absolute path to a custom theme file.
# Ghostty also supports specifying a different theme to use for light and dark mode.
# Each option is documented below.
#
# If the theme is an absolute pathname, Ghostty will attempt to load that file as a theme.
# If that file does not exist or is inaccessible, an error will be logged and no other directories will be searched.
#
# If the theme is not an absolute pathname, two different directories will be searched for a file name that matches the theme.
# This is case sensitive on systems with case-sensitive filesystems.
# It is an error for a theme name to include path separators unless it is an absolute pathname.
#
# The first directory is the `themes` subdirectory of your Ghostty configuration directory.
# This is `$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/ghostty/themes` or `~/.config/ghostty/themes`.
#
# The second directory is the `themes` subdirectory of the Ghostty resources directory.
# Ghostty ships with a multitude of themes that will be installed into this directory.
# On macOS, this list is in the `Ghostty.app/Contents/ Resources/ghostty/themes` directory.
# On Linux, this list is in the `share/ ghostty/themes` directory (wherever you installed the Ghostty "share" directory.
#
# To see a list of available themes, run `ghostty +list-themes`.
#
# A theme file is simply another Ghostty configuration file.
# They share the same syntax and same configuration options.
# A theme can set any valid configuration option so please do not use a theme file from an untrusted source.
# The built-in themes are audited to only set safe configuration options.
#
# Some options cannot be set within theme files.
# The reason these are not supported should be self-evident.
# A theme file cannot set `theme` or `config-file`.
# At the time of writing this, Ghostty will not show any warnings or errors if you set these options in a theme file but they will be silently ignored.
#
# Any additional colors specified via background, foreground, palette, etc.
# will override the colors specified in the theme.
#
# To specify a different theme for light and dark mode, use the following syntax: `light:theme-name,dark:theme-name`.
# For example: `light:rose-pine-dawn,dark:rose-pine`.
# Whitespace around all values are trimmed and order of light and dark does not matter.
# Both light and dark must be specified in this form.
# In this form, the theme used will be based on the current desktop environment theme.
#
# There are some known bugs with light/dark mode theming.
# These will be fixed in a future update:
#
#   - macOS: titlebar tabs style is not updated when switching themes.

# This sets the default style.
# A running program can still request an explicit cursor style using escape sequences (such as `CSI q`).
# Shell configurations will often request specific cursor styles.
#
# Note that shell integration will automatically set the cursor to a bar at a prompt, regardless of this configuration.
# You can disable that behavior by specifying `shell-integration-features = no-cursor` or disabling shell integration entirely.

# same as a "true" value, as noted below.
#
# If this is not set at all (`null`),
# then Ghostty will respect DEC Mode 12 (AT&T cursor blink) as an alternate approach to turning blinking on/off.
# If this is set to any value other than null,
# DEC mode 12 will be ignored but `DECSCUSR` will still be respected.

# Alternate screen applications like vim usually have their own version of this feature but this configuration doesn't control that.
#
# It should be noted that this feature works by translating your desired position into a series of synthetic arrow key movements,
# so some weird behavior around edge cases are to be expected.
# This is unfortunately how this feature is implemented across terminals because there isn't any other way to implement it.
